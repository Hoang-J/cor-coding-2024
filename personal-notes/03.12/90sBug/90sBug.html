Create a clone of one of your favorite website pages but plant a bug in the clone. whenever someone clicks on a button or fills out a form, cause a new box to appear that states â€œVirus! With a picture of a bug in the box. The window that appears should look like a 90s window with a minimize and exit button. When the user tries to minimize or exit out of the window, a new box should be created on the page with the same virus warning and image.  -->
